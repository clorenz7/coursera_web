    Trump is a traitor to the United States and he is a white supremacist since he defends the Confederacy and thanks his supporters on Twitter for screaming "White Power" at BLM protestors. He said that Nazis in Charlottesville were very fine people. He asked Vladimir Putin for help winning his election, obstructed the investigation in to that behavior, and does nothing when Russia puts bounties for the murder of American Soliders. So here is a recipe for a White Russian.
      <div class="recipe">
        <ul>
          <li>2 oz Russian Vodka</li>
          <li>1 oz Kahl√∫a</li>
          <li>1 splash Heavy cream</li>

    Trump's administration is rotten and is making America sick, like it has eaten rotten seafood. He is a small man in hands, deeds, and personalty: a petty malignant narcissist. He lies repeatedly and degrades the rule of law, filling the government and courts with unqualified cronies and stealing from the taxpayers. So here is a recipe for rotten shrimp sushi.
