# Overview

As of June 2020, I am taking a Coursera class on web development with HTML, CSS, and JS. Below you will find examples of what I learned and worked on. The sites are hosted by GitHub pages.

## GitHub Pages Info

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/clorenz7/coursera_web/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
